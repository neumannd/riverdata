\title{Calculates mean values from MOM river input data}
\usage{
\method{mean}{river.mom}(inData, from = inData$tstep, to = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{inData}{list containing a data.frame (in$data) with river inflow data, a character array (in$units) with corresponding units, and two character variables (in$format and in$tstep).}

\item{from}{character: current data averaging interval; does not need to be set if in$tstep is set properly; if not, it can be manually set to e.g. 'annual', 'monthly', or 'daily'}

\item{to}{character: future averaging interval; e.g. 'annual', 'monthly', or 'daily'}
}
\value{
list of newly averaged data; same structure as input data; 

          list containing a data.frame (out$data), a character array 
          (out$units), and two character variables (out$format and
          out$tstep). The first contains the actual data formatted as a 
          data.frame. The second contains the units to the corresponding 
          columns of the data.frame. The third contains the source/format 
          of data (here: 'mom'; can also be 'swat'). The fourth contains
          information on the time step of the data (resp.: on which time
          interval they are averaged).

\description{
Calculates mean values from river inflow data. Currently, only averaging 
from monthly to annual means is implemented.

\examples{

  # read a file:
  test.mom.monthly <- read.mom('files/GER_Dan_Str_Warnow.dat')
  
  # calculate annual means from monthly data
  test.mom.annual <- mean.river.mom(test.mom.monthly, to = 'anual')
