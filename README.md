# R riverdata package

This package should summarize some functions, which I used to read some river data into R and write it into input files for HBM-ERGOM model runs. With 'river data' I denote (in this context) river runoff and nutrient loads at the river-sea-interface. Some SWAT (SWAT 2012 version format) and MOM input files can be read with these functions.
